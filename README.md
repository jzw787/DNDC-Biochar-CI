# DNDC-Biochar-CI
A new version of DNDCv9.5, DNDC-Biochar-CI was developed by researchers in Hohai University. Biochar was added as a new type of manure, including different genres of parameters, C/N ratio, organic C, organic N, NH4+, NO3-, absorption ratio, manure pH, labile biochar rate, MRT of labile biochar pool, MRT or recalcitrant biochar pool and so on. Besides, the controlled irrigation, a water-saving irrigation method of paddy without standing water, module was also added in the flood module based on the water balance principle. The modified model could be used to simulate GHG emissions from paddy fields under biochar amendment and controlled irrigation in future climate conditions.
